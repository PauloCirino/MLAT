\usage{
svm_poli(X_train, Y_train, X_test, degree, gamma, coef0, C)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_train}{A Matrix of trainning observations.}

\item{Y_train}{A numeric vector of classes or values of the trainning observations.}

\item{X_test}{A Matrix of testing observations.}

\item{degree}{A integer that represents the kernel polynomial degree}

\item{gamma}{A numeric value as the kernel coefficient.}

\item{coef0}{A numeric value for kernel independent term.}

\item{C}{A numeric value that represents the cost of constraints violation of the regularization term in the Lagrange formulation.}
}
\value{
predicted labels
}
